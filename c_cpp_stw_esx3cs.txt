# Working with CAN Open libraries such as COL2, OSY L2
- The constant CAN configurations might have to go with static const for working properly.
- OSY L2 has to be initilized and used first before COL2.
- DLC (Data Length Code) on OpenSYDE needs to be exact for OSY L2 to be working.

# Procedure of adding new node into system
- Checking OpenSYDE L2 library filter for RX messages.
- Checking CANOpen COL library for node list.
- Adding nodes into OpenSYDE tool in order (it is a must).
- Adding EDS file for each node in order (it is a must).
- Checking DLC.
- Export OpenSYDE library gen to project folder: libosygen.
- Remove/Add files into the project with CodeBlocks.
- Rebuild --> Testing
