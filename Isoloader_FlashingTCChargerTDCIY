Flashing the TC Charger DC-DC Converter (model: TDC-IY)

Reason
  The firmware inside the DC-DC converter operates the CAN bus at baudrate 500 kbps. It need to be flashed new firmware to operate CAN bus at baudrate 250 kbps.
  
The DC-DC converter cannot be flashed due to several errors:
  - The ZLG CANUSB and its driver are not working properly --> This theory has been tested, the unit and its driver are working perfectly fine with the program CANTest.

Conclusion
  - The last fail was due to the version of the software (fail version 7.232) --> Referred version: 7.39
